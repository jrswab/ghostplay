# GhostPlay

A flexible Go framework for implementing account-free gamification in your applications.

## Origin

Remember playing baseball as a kid when you didn't have enough players? You'd use a "ghost player" that could progress through the bases even though they weren't physically there. GhostPlay brings this same concept to application gamification - allowing users to participate and progress without the need to create an account.

## About

GhostPlay is a framework that enables developers to add gamification features to their applications without requiring users to create accounts. It provides the core infrastructure for tracking progress, managing achievements, and storing game state while giving developers full flexibility in how they implement and store this data.

### Key Features

- Account-free gamification
- Storage-agnostic design with Redis caching support
- Flexible interfaces for custom data storage
- Framework-level primitives for building gamification systems
- Clean, focused API

## Installation
